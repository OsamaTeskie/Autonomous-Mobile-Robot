# Autonomous-Mobile-Robot

Used an Arduino and a combination of limit switches, IR sensors, and ultrasonic sensors to build an autonomous mobile robot that can navigate a real-world course. This robot can follow a predetermined path, avoid obstacles, locate a parking spot, and park on command, all while remaining on the surface.
